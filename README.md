Q7) Calculate Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation, Range &  comment about the values / draw inferences, for the given dataset For Points,Score,Weigh? 


Q9) Calculate Skewness, Kurtosis & draw inferences on the following data  Cars speed and distance? 1) speed&distance:-  2) SP and Weight(WT):-


Q11)  Suppose we want to estimate the average weight of an adult male in    Mexico. We draw a random sample of 2,000 men from a population of 3,000,000 men and weigh them. We find that the average person in our sample weighs 200 pounds, and the standard deviation of the sample is 30 pounds. Calculate 94%,98%,96% confidence interval?


Q12)  Below are the scores obtained by a student in tests 34,36,36,38,38,39,39,40,40,41,41,41,41,42,42,45,49,56 1) Find mean, median, variance, standard deviation. 2)	What can we say about the student marks? 


Q 20) Calculate probability from the given dataset for the below cases
       Calculate the probability of MPG  of Cars for the below cases.
       MPG <- Cars$MPG
a.	P(MPG>38)
b.	P(MPG<40)
c.    P (20<MPG<50)


Q 21) Check whether the data follows normal distribution a)	Check whether the MPG of Cars follows Normal Distribution  b)	Check Whether the Adipose Tissue (AT) and Waist Circumference(Waist)  from wc-at data set  follows Normal Distribution 


Q 22) Calculate the Z scores of  90% confidence interval,94% confidence interval, 60% confidence interval    


Q 23) Calculate the t scores of 95% confidence interval, 96% confidence interval, 99% confidence interval for sample size of 25
